# `C++ Learning Modules (CPP00â€“CPP09)`

Welcome to the C++ Learning Modules, a structured series designed to guide you through the essentials and advanced concepts of C++ programming. Spanning ten modules (CPP00 to CPP09), this collection builds your skills progressively, from foundational principles to complex applications. Each module includes a PDF with exercises and solutions to support your learning.

## `Module Overview`

### `CPP00: Introduction to C++ Basics`
This module covers the core building blocks of C++:
- **Namespaces**: Organize code to prevent naming conflicts.
- **Classes and Member Functions**: Define custom types and their behaviors.
- **Standard I/O Streams**: Manage input/output with `stdio` streams.
- **Initialization Lists**: Initialize class members efficiently.
- **Static and Const Keywords**: Control shared resources and ensure immutability.
Perfect for beginners, this module establishes a solid foundation for object-oriented programming.

### `CPP01: Memory Management and Core Concepts`
Explore memory handling and key C++ features:
- **Memory Allocation**: Use `new` and `delete` for dynamic memory management.
- **References**: Create variable aliases for cleaner code.
- **Pointers to Members**: Access class members dynamically.
- **Switch Statements**: Implement multi-way branching for streamlined control flow.
This module strengthens your understanding of memory and program control.

### `CPP02: Polymorphism and Canonical Classes`
Dive into advanced object-oriented techniques:
- **Ad-Hoc Polymorphism**: Overload functions for flexible behavior.
- **Operator Overloading**: Customize operators for user-defined types.
- **Orthodox Canonical Form**: Implement standard class structure (default constructor, copy constructor, destructor, assignment operator).
This module focuses on creating robust, reusable classes.

### `CPP03: Inheritance and Polymorphism`
Learn to build hierarchical relationships:
- **Inheritance**: Extend functionality with derived classes.
- **Polymorphism**: Enable dynamic behavior through virtual functions.
This module introduces techniques for code reuse and flexibility.

### `CPP04: Advanced Polymorphism and Interfaces`
Deepen your understanding of polymorphism:
- **Abstract Classes and Interfaces**: Define contracts for derived classes.
- **Advanced Operator Overloading**: Enhance class functionality.
- **Canonical Classes Revisited**: Reinforce proper class design.
This module emphasizes designing extensible, modular systems.

### `CPP05: Exception Handling`
Master error management:
- **Exceptions**: Handle runtime errors using try-catch blocks.
- **Error Handling Strategies**: Build robust, fault-tolerant programs.
This module teaches you to write reliable code that gracefully handles errors.

### `CPP06: Type Casting`
Understand type conversions:
- **Casts**: Use `static_cast`, `dynamic_cast`, `const_cast`, and `reinterpret_cast` safely.
This module equips you to manage type conversions effectively, avoiding common pitfalls.

### `CPP07: Templates and STL Containers`
Explore generic programming:
- **Templates**: Write reusable, type-agnostic code.
- **STL Containers**: Use `vector`, `list`, `map`, and other containers for efficient data management.
This module introduces tools for writing flexible, high-performance programs.

### `CPP08: Mastering the Standard Template Library (STL)`
Dive deeper into the STL:
- **STL Algorithms and Iterators**: Process and manipulate container data efficiently.
- **Advanced STL Usage**: Leverage STL utilities for complex tasks.
This module enhances your ability to use C++â€™s built-in libraries effectively.

### `CPP09: Applied C++ and STL`
Apply your skills to real-world problems:
- **Converting Research Papers to Code**: Translate theoretical concepts into practical C++ implementations.
- **Advanced STL Techniques**: Use STL tools to simplify complex tasks.
This module bridges theory and practice, preparing you for advanced projects.

## `Resources`
Each module includes a PDF with:
- **Exercises**: Practical tasks to reinforce learning.
- **Solutions**: Detailed explanations to guide your progress.
Review these PDFs thoroughly, as they contain essential insights and examples.
