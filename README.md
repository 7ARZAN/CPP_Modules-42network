C++ Learning Modules (CPP00â€“CPP09)
Welcome to the C++ Learning Modules, a comprehensive series designed to guide you through the fundamentals and advanced concepts of C++ programming. This collection spans ten modules (CPP00 to CPP09), each focusing on key aspects of C++ to build a strong foundation and progressively deepen your understanding. Each module includes a PDF with detailed exercises and solutions to support your learning journey.
Module Overview
CPP00: Introduction to C++ Basics
This module introduces foundational C++ concepts, including:

Namespaces: Organize code and avoid naming conflicts.
Classes and Member Functions: Define custom data types and their behaviors.
Standard I/O Streams: Handle input and output using stdio streams.
Initialization Lists: Efficiently initialize class members.
Static and Const Keywords: Manage shared resources and enforce immutability.This module is perfect for beginners, laying the groundwork for object-oriented programming.

CPP01: Memory Management and Core Concepts
Dive into memory management and essential C++ features:

Memory Allocation: Understand dynamic memory using new and delete.
References: Create aliases for variables to simplify code.
Pointers to Members: Access class members dynamically.
Switch Statements: Implement multi-way branching for cleaner control flow.This module strengthens your understanding of memory and control structures.

CPP02: Polymorphism and Canonical Classes
Explore advanced object-oriented principles:

Ad-Hoc Polymorphism: Overload functions for flexible behavior.
Operator Overloading: Customize operators for user-defined types.
Orthodox Canonical Form: Implement standard class structure (default constructor, copy constructor, destructor, and assignment operator).This module focuses on writing robust, reusable classes.

CPP03: Inheritance and Polymorphism
Learn how to build hierarchical relationships:

Inheritance: Create derived classes to extend functionality.
Polymorphism: Enable dynamic behavior through virtual functions.This module introduces techniques for code reuse and flexibility.

CPP04: Advanced Polymorphism and Interfaces
Deepen your knowledge of polymorphism:

Abstract Classes and Interfaces: Define contracts for derived classes.
Advanced Operator Overloading: Enhance class functionality.
Canonical Classes Revisited: Reinforce proper class design.This module emphasizes designing flexible, extensible systems.

CPP05: Exception Handling
Master error management:

Exceptions: Handle runtime errors gracefully using try-catch blocks.
Error Handling Strategies: Design robust programs that recover from failures.This module teaches you to write reliable, fault-tolerant code.

CPP06: Type Casting
Understand type conversions in C++:

Casts: Use static_cast, dynamic_cast, const_cast, and reinterpret_cast safely.This module equips you to handle type conversions effectively and avoid common pitfalls.

CPP07: Templates and STL Containers
Explore generic programming:

Templates: Write reusable, type-agnostic code.
STL Containers: Use standard containers like vector, list, and map for efficient data management.This module introduces powerful tools for writing flexible, efficient programs.

CPP08: Mastering the Standard Template Library (STL)
Dive deeper into the STL:

STL Algorithms and Iterators: Manipulate and process container data efficiently.
Advanced STL Usage: Leverage STL utilities for complex tasks.This module enhances your ability to use C++â€™s built-in libraries effectively.

CPP09: Applied C++ and STL
Apply your knowledge to real-world scenarios:

Converting Research Papers to Code: Translate theoretical concepts into practical C++ implementations.
Advanced STL Techniques: Simplify complex tasks using STL tools.This module bridges theory and practice, preparing you for advanced projects.

Resources
Each module includes a PDF containing:

Exercises: Practical tasks to reinforce concepts.
Solutions: Detailed explanations to guide your learning.Be sure to review these PDFs, as they provide critical insights and examples to help you master each topic.
